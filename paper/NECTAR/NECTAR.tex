Traditionally, urban road space allocation has relied on the
hierarchical street classification, favoring traffic lanes in arterials
and allocating more space to parking or sidewalks in local streets.
However, a dilemma arises in more complex urban environments that face
limitations in space and must accommodate both mobility and access
functions. Additionally, these zones tend to have high intensity and
fluctuation of multimodal demands, leading to underutilized spaces at
certain times of the day. There is a potential to reallocate space
dynamically over time according to fluctuations of demand, having a more
efficient and just space distribution. We define a complex space as
facing the mobility vs access dilemma, having high connectivity, having
dense and diverse land use and with high levels of traffic or/and public
transport at least one hour of the day. Zones with these characteristics
tend to have scarce urban space to fulfill the street's mobility and
access functions.

To address this issue, we propose a site selection methodology to
identify complex zones within cities on a macro scale where diverse
users and demands compete for space. These zones require a deeper
understanding of urban dynamics to prioritize sustainable transportation
policy. The proposed methodology uses open data such as road network,
information on population and transit and trafficroad network, land use,
and traffic and public transport levels of service, provided by
OpenStreetMaps, national census, Google Maps API and General Transit
Feed Specification (GTFS) sources. We propose indicators and a network
flow to determine locations that we consider complex to reallocate road
space. We developed an R package that can reproduce the proposed
methodology in any location in Portugal.

In previous work we demonstrated this application through a case study
in Lisbon, offering planners a starting point to assess activities and
temporal-spatial demands when reallocating road space. Adaptations from
the initial methodology were needed due to the different contexts, and
scale of analysis.

This methodology could be expanded not only to other countries (as long
as required data exists) but also for applications such as identifying
30km/h zones.
